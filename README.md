This repository contains examples of common Python errors related to list processing and type handling. The `bug.py` file shows code that can cause a `ZeroDivisionError` when an empty list is passed to a function calculating the average and a TypeError if a list contains a string. The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates how to fix these errors using exception handling and type checking.
